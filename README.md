Project Overview
- This project analyzes Adidas sales performance using Power BI to generate data-driven insights that support business, product, and pricing decisions. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders quickly understand trends in revenue, profitability, product demand, and regional performance.
- The goal is to simulate a real-world product analytics / data analyst workflow, translating raw sales data into clear KPIs and actionable recommendations.

Business Objectives
- The analysis focuses on answering key business questions:
- How is Adidas performing overall, and how has performance changed over time?
- Which regions and products are driving revenue and profit?
- Where are there opportunities to optimize pricing, margins, or inventory?
- How can data insights support strategic and operational decision-making?

Problem Statement
- Adidas operates across multiple products, regions, and pricing tiers, making it difficult to quickly assess performance and identify improvement areas without a centralized analytics view.
- This project addresses that challenge by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that surfaces core KPIs, enabling faster, more informed business and product decisions.
